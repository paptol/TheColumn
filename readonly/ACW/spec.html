<h2>08214 Assessed Coursework Specification</h2>
<p>
The goal of the per student data for this assessment is to give you the opportunity 
to collaborate with your peers with a reduced risk of plagiarism. This <b>does not</b> mean you can copy code from another student, 
but hopefully you can learn from each others code and apply what you have learnt to your own solution.</p>
<p>For your own records you should try to commit your work to SVN whenever a new piece of functionality is completed, with an appropriate message.
To help you maintain focus you might want to write an ordered list of the necessary tasks you will need to complete. As you complete each task you should commit 
your work with a description of the task you have just completed.
</p>
<p>
This assessment is described as a series of cubes. Each cube should have a dimension of 100 cm. Pictures are for illustration only. There may be slight changes between the data you have been given and the pictures shown.
</p>
<p>As well as using this document, you should also refer to the ACW specification that is published at the module site on sharepoint.</p>
<h3>The Emitter Box</h3>
<p>The purpose of the emitter box is to add balls into the column. 
It should add balls randomly at a rate that is fast enough to produce collisions between balls as they fall down the column and bounce off of cylinders etc. 
The emitter box should produce 2 different types of balls
The first type of ball should have a radius of 5cm and a density of 0.0012 kg per centimetre cubed and should be a matt Orange colour. The second type of ball should have a radius of 7cm and a density of 0.0014 kg per metre cubed and should be a shiny DodgerBlue colour.  Please see the picture.</p><img src="balls.jpg"/><img src="ballsPlan.jpg"/><h3>The Grid Box - level 1</h3><p>You should have three cylinders with a radius of 7.5cm and one with a radius of 15cm. From the centre of the box the larger cylinder should be translated across by 17cm. A smaller cylinder should be translated away from the larger one by 23cm in the opposite direction so that the gap between them is 40cm. The other two cylinders should pass through the cylinders at right angles. Their centres should be separated by 50cm (moving each cylinder 25cm in opposite directions). Please see the picture.</p><img src="AACylinders.jpg"/><img src="AACylindersPlan.jpg"/><h3>The Grid Box - level 2</h3><p>You should have two cylidners of radius 15cm. Each cylinder should be rotated 45 degrees in opposite directions and their centres should be separted by 50 cm in the vertical axis, moving one cylinder up by 25cm and the other down by 25 cm. Please see the picture.</p><img src="NAACylinders.jpg"/><img src="NAACylindersPlan.jpg"/><h3>The Sphere Of Doom Box</h3><p>Your sphere of doom should have a radius of 30 and should be coloured ForestGreen</p><img src="doom.jpg"/><img src="doomPlan.jpg"/>
<p>This specification is intended as guidance. You should add textures, lighting etc as you see fit. Please refer to the full specification on the sharepoint site.</p>
